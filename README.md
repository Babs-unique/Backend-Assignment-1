Intro to Backend Development 


SECTION A — Intro to Backend (Theory)

1. Backend development focuses on everything that happens behind the scenes of a website — the server, database, and application logic.
Frontend is what the user sees and interacts with.


2. Three backend languages:

JavaScript (Node.js)

Python

PHP



3. A server is a computer that receives requests from users and returns responses. It runs backend code, processes data, talks to databases, and makes sure everything works.


4. An API (Application Programming Interface) allows two systems or applications to communicate. It exposes endpoints that frontend or other services can use.


5. A database is where data is stored, organized, and managed. It’s important because backend systems need a reliable way to save and retrieve information.


6. Two differences between SQL and NoSQL:

SQL uses tables; NoSQL uses flexible structures like documents.

SQL is relational; NoSQL is non-relational.



7. A backend framework provides tools and structure for building backend applications.
Example: Express.js.


8. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the communication protocol the web uses. It defines how clients and servers send and receive data.


9. Two responsibilities of a backend developer:

Building APIs and server logic

Managing databases and data flow



10. CRUD stands for:

Create — add new data

Read — fetch data

Update — modify data

Delete — remove data



11. Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s identity. It’s important because it protects user data and prevents unauthorized access.


12. GET request retrieves data from a server.
POST request sends data to a server (usually for creating something).

SECTION B — JavaScript Variables & Datatypes (Theory)

1. A variable is a container used to store data in JavaScript.


2. Three ways to declare variables:

var

let

const



3. let allows reassignment; const cannot be reassigned after its initial value.


4. Seven primitive datatypes:

string

number

boolean

null

undefined

symbol

bigint



5. The value true is a boolean datatype.


6. A JavaScript array is of datatype object.


7. Example of a string:
"Hello"


8. Example of a number:
25


9. Output of typeof "123" is:
"string"


10. null represents an intentional empty value.
undefined means a variable has been declared but has no value yet.
